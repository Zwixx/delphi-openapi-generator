Use a table's ID value in a fulfillment policy to specify the shipping rate table to use for that policy's DOMESTIC or INTERNATIONAL shipping option (make sure the locality of the rate table matches the optionType of the shipping option). This call currently supports getting rate tables related to the following marketplaces: EBAY_AU EBAY_CA EBAY_IT EBAY_US Note: Rate tables created with the Trading API might not have been assigned a rateTableId at the time of their creation. This method can assign and return rateTableId values for rate tables with missing IDs if you make a request using the country_code where the seller has defined rate tables. Sellers can define up to 40 shipping rate tables for their account, which lets them set up different rate tables for each of the marketplaces they sell into. Go to My eBay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences to create and maintain the rate tables. For more, see Using shipping rate tables. If you're using the Trading API, use the rate table ID values in the RateTableDetails container of the Add/Revise/Relist calls. If the locality for a rate table is set to DOMESTIC, pass the ID value in the RateTableDetails.DomesticRateTableId field. Otherwise, if locality is INTERNATIONAL, pass the ID value in RateTableDetails.InternationalRateTableId.

A successful request returns the URI to the new policy in the Location response header and the ID for the new policy is returned in the response payload. Tip: For details on creating and using the business policies supported by the Account API, see eBay business policies.

Specify the tax table entry you want to configure using the two path parameters: countryCode and jurisdictionId. A tax table entry for a jurisdiction is comprised of two fields: one for the jurisdiction's sales-tax rate and another that's a boolean value indicating whether or not shipping and handling are taxed in the jurisdiction. You can set up tax tables for countries that support different tax jurisdictions. Currently, only Canada, India, and the US support separate tax jurisdictions. If you sell into any of these countries, you can set up tax tables for any of the country's jurisdictions. Retrieve valid jurisdiction IDs using getSalesTaxJurisdictions in the Metadata API. For details on using this call, see Establishing sales-tax tables. Important! Starting in January 2019, eBay will begin to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers. This feature is rolling out on specific dates to specific US states as defined on the following page: eBay sales tax collection. Once eBay starts to collect sales tax for a state, no action is required on the seller's part and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax. The sales-tax collection process will apply to all the sales in the states that support this feature, whether the seller is located in or outside of the United States. When a buyer purchases an item on eBay, and the ship-to address is one of the states where eBay collects the sales tax, eBay will calculate and add the applicable sales tax at checkout. The buyer will pay both the cost of the item along with the sales tax. eBay will collect and remit the tax.",

Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears.

IMPORTANT: Extended Holiday Returns is a seasonally available feature that is offered on some eBay marketplaces. To see if the feature is enabled in any given year, check the Returns on eBay page before the holiday season begins. If the feature is not enabled for the season, this field is ignored. The extended holiday returns period is defined by three dates: The start date = start of November. The purchase cutoff date = end of the year. The end date = end of January. The above dates may vary by a few days each year. Sellers are notified of the current dates on their eBay marketplace before the holiday period starts. Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears. Purchases made from that point on are subject to the non-holiday returns period, while purchases made before the cutoff date still have until the end of the period to return under the program.
